            <h2><a name="foreword">1. Foreword</a></h2>
            <p>
                This program is an editor for Commodore 64 sprites. I have written it
                as my small competition for free version of SpritePad and addressing
                a few drawbacks of already mentioned SpritePad's free version. It is
                not my intention to dethrone SpritePad, especially its commercial version
                should be better choice anyway. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please let me introduce these drawbacks and my solutions implemented in
                "Master of Sprites". The main problems are: lack of batch mode support,
                poor support for animation with sprite overlay or lack of support for
                displaying connected multisprites. There are also some minor problems
                like portability issues on operating systems different than Windows or
                or relatively old-fashioned and unhandy user interface. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The problems with portability are maybe not so big and important - SpritePad
                runs perfectly well on Wine after all. However personally I feel it's
                always good and satisfying to have similar program made in Java. In other hand
                I didn't made anything much better in the topic of user interface. I feel
                fine with overall look & feel of "Master of Sprites" but everything is
                pretty standard as for Java Swing application. There are many drawbacks too.
            </p>
            <p>
                The already mentioned main problems was my biggest motivation to make
                this program. Master of Sprites is capable to export its project from
                command line interface. The preview tab of its main window contains nice
                animation preview with support for both overlay and multisprites. The "Overlay
                Distance" setting makes easy to "arrange" memory bank in the way which takes
                into account both animation and overlay. <em>If you check "Overlay Next Sprite"
                option then current sprite will automatically overlay the sprite, further by
                "Overlay Distance", in the memory bank. It is just that simple.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                If some buttons or options of this program are mysterious thing for
                you, please take a look at <i>"Quick Guide to the GUI"</i> chapter. If you want
                to know how to export files from command line then go directly to <i>"Command Line
                Parameters"</i>. I think this is enough for an introduction.

            <h3>Opening Project From Command Line</h3>
            <blockquote>
                java -jar MasterofSprites.jar <i>project_file</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                With the command above you can open some project file from the command
                line interface. <em>Unfortunally it doesn't support opening multiple windows
                with multiple projects.</em>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Export From Command Line</h3>
            <p>
                Master of Sprites offers ability to export its projects from command line
                as well from shell scripts or batch files. Syntax of appropriate command
                is showed below:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                java -jar MasterofSprites.jar -e [format] <i>project_file</i> [-o <i>output_file</i>]
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Avaible export formats are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Raw binary</strong> - default export format. If you leave
                    the <i>format</i> argument <i>empty</i> you will export your project as the
                    raw binary. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PRG file</strong> - if you want to export to a PRG file then
                    specify load address of your output PRG file as the <i>hexadecimal number
                    prefixed with "0x".</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assembly source code</strong> - there is possible to export
                    projects to source code of these three popular assemblers: <i>ACME</i>, <i>KickAss</i>
                    and <i>TMPx</i>. Just replace the <i>format</i> argument with the name of one of these
                    three assemblers. Names are case insensitive here, so both ACME or acme or
                    even aCMe are valid names.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not specify output file then Master of Sprites will just
                change extension of your project file to raw, prg or asm.
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>Unfortunally currenty is not possible to make multiple exports in one
                command by using wildcards like '*' or '?'.</em> On UNIX-like operating
                systems you can do the same job by looping in the shell script or by
                using capabilities of makefiles. Worse if you are using Windows batch
                files - as far as I know there is no looping there. :(
