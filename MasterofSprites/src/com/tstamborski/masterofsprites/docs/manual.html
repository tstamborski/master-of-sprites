            <h2><a name="foreword">1. Foreword</a></h2>
            <p>
                This program is an editor for Commodore 64 sprites. I have written it
                as my small competition for free version of SpritePad and addressing
                a few drawbacks of already mentioned SpritePad's free version. It is
                not my intention to dethrone SpritePad, especially its commercial version
                should be better choice anyway. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Please let me introduce these drawbacks and my solutions implemented in
                "Master of Sprites". The main problems are: lack of batch mode support,
                poor support for animation with sprite overlay or lack of support for
                displaying connected multisprites. There are also some minor problems
                like small portability issues on operating systems different than Windows
                or relatively old-fashioned and unhandy user interface. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The problems with portability are maybe not so big and important - SpritePad
                runs perfectly well on Wine after all. However personally I feel it's
                always good and satisfying to have similar program made in Java. In other hand
                I didn't made anything much better in the topic of user interface. I feel
                fine with overall look & feel of "Master of Sprites" but everything is
                pretty standard as for Java Swing application. There are many drawbacks too.
            </p>
            <p>
                The already mentioned main problems was my biggest motivation to make
                this program. Master of Sprites is capable to export its project from
                command line interface. The preview tab of its main window contains nice
                animation preview with support for both overlay and multisprites. The "Overlay
                Distance" setting makes easy to "arrange" memory bank in the way which takes
                into account both animation and overlay. <em>If you check "Overlay by Next Sprite"
                option then current sprite will be automatically overlayed by the sprite, further by
                "Overlay Distance", in the memory bank. It is just that simple.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                If some buttons or options of this program are mysterious thing for
                you, please take a look at <i>"Quick Guide to the GUI"</i> chapter. If you want
                to know how to export files from command line then go directly to <i>"Command Line
                Parameters"</i>. I think this is enough for an introduction.

            <h2><a name="newfeatures">2. New features in the version 1.0</a></h2>
            <p>
                The version 1.0 introduce a new feature - ghost skinning. There are 4 different
                ghost skinning modes designed to work with animations or overlayed sprites or both.
                To switch between these modes go to the <i>View->Set Ghost Skinning</i> dialog window
                and choose which one to use. The dialog is hidden also under convienient keyboard shortcut
                <i>CTRL + SPACEBAR</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application by default use <i>"Overlay stack skinning"</i>
                which is helpful to show overlayed sprites in the editor component instead of only
                in the <i>"Preview"</i> tab. <i>"Previous in memory skinning"</i> and <i>"Previous in selection skinning"</i>
                are probably self-explaining. They are useful in creation of animations. <i>"Intelligent animation & overlay mode"</i>
                combines <i>"Overlay stack skinning"</i> and <i>"Previous in memory skinning"</i>. Additionaly it wraps memory in
                the portions defined by <i>"Overlay Distance"</i>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <i>"Selection"</i> menu was somewhat rearranged - most commands you can find now in the <i>"Commands"</i> submenu.
                The <i>"View"</i> menu has now two new options - <i>"Editor Grid"</i> and <i>"Set Ghost Skinning"</i>. In the <i>"File"</i>
                menu, you can find now a few example projects.
            </p>
            <P>
                The <i>"Memory"</i> tab has now new block selection mode - try to hold <i>ALT</i> to select any rectangular area of memory.
            </P>
            <p>
                In previous version 0.12 sprites was overlayed in opposive direction. Now it is changed to order more natural for machine and
                identical as in SpritePad, so you can easily import files exported from SpritePad. I have also modified format of attributes byte
                to match with SpritePad.

            <h2><a name="quickguidetothegui">3. Quick Guide to the GUI</a></h2>
            
            <h3>Editor Panel on the Left Side</h3>
            <p>
                Editor Panel is used for drawing and editing one particular sprite
                from current selection. At the same top of the panel you can see two
                opposite buttons which are used for choosing current sprite from all
                selected sprites. Although some options here, like background color
                or overlay distance, are project wide and affects all sprites in memory
                bank.
            </p>
            <p>
                Buttons below of the editor view itself are the same as corresponding commands
                from the the sprite menu. Current color options and color picker should be
                obvious thing for you if you are making sprites for Commodore 64. I will
                maybe just highlight few things about editor view:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Right mouse button</i> is used for erasing - it always puts the
                    background color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>CTRL + left or right click</i> is used for flood fill whole area
                    of the same color.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <i>Mouse wheel</i>, if you hover cursor at editor view, will quickly
                    change the current color option.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Multicolor option is probably obvious too, but lets talk about <i>"Overlay
                by Next Sprite"</i> and <i>"Overlay Distance"</i>. <i>"Overlay Distance"</i> is
                a project wide option which decide how far in memory bank is the next overlayed
                sprite. By default it is 8 sprites further, so next layer of overlay is one
                row below in the <i>"Memory"</i> tab. <i>"Overlay by Next Sprite"</i> is unchecked
                by default and you must check it to overlay starts work.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Memory Tab on the Right Side</h3>
            <p>
                Here you can change the selection and view all sprites in the same order
                as in the C64 memory. You can also change the size of memory bank by using
                <i>"Quantity"</i> spinner below the view ("Delete" command from menu just
                clears currently selected sprites). 
            </p>
            <p>
                If you want to make multiple sprites selection you should hold <i>CTRL</i> or
                <i>SHIFT</i> key while clicking by mouse. Curious thing is how copy and paste
                works here - pasting fills whole selection by clipboard content, so you can
                easily copy one sprite and paste it over whole memory bank.
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Preview Tab on the Right Side</h3>
            <p>
                Here you can preview your animation or overlayed sprites. There is also the
                <i>"Arrangement"</i> option useful when you want to preview a multisprite
                made from a few connected single sprites. Lets shortly describe also other
                options.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <i>"Count"</i> and <i>"Delay"</i> options next to the player buttons.
                <i>"Count"</i> is the number of animation frames - you must change it to
                something above one to see your animation. <i>"Delay"</i> is the number
                of miliseconds between animation frames. It decides how fast or slow animation
                runs. The Default is 100ms which corresponds 10Hz so you will probably want
                to change it to smaller value for faster animation. Minimal value of 20ms
                is 50Hz.
            </p>
            <p>
                The two buttons at the top right: one with ping-pong palette and second with
                lock. <i>The ping-pong button</i> cause animation flows in different way - it doesn't
                loop from beginning but instead it bounces from first frame to the last and
                vice versa. <i>The lock button</i> cause preview freeze on the current selection - 
                if pressed you can change selection in "Memory" tab and it will not change
                your preview.
            </p>

            <p>
                Remember that on Microsoft Windows you must first add your Master of Sprites installation
                folder to the <i>PATH</i> enviroment variable to can easily use it from command line.

            <blockquote>
                java -jar MasterofSprites.jar <i>project_file</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                With the command above you can open some project file from the command
                line interface. <em>Unfortunally it doesn't support opening multiple windows
                with multiple projects.</em>
            </p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Export From Command Line</h3>
            <p>
                Master of Sprites offers ability to export its projects from command line
                as well from shell scripts or batch files. Syntax of appropriate command
                is showed below:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                MasterofSprites -e [format] <i>project_file</i> [-o <i>output_file</i>]
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote>
                java -jar MasterofSprites.jar -e [format] <i>project_file</i> [-o <i>output_file</i>]
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Avaible export formats are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Raw binary</strong> - default export format. If you leave
                    the <i>format</i> argument <i>empty</i> you will export your project as the
                    raw binary. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PRG file</strong> - if you want to export to a PRG file then
                    specify load address of your output PRG file as the <i>hexadecimal number
                    prefixed with "0x".</i>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assembly source code</strong> - there is possible to export
                    projects to source code of these three popular assemblers: <i>ACME</i>, <i>KickAss</i>
                    and <i>TMPx</i>. Just replace the <i>format</i> argument with the name of one of these
                    three assemblers. Names are case insensitive here, so both ACME or acme or
                    even aCMe are valid names.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not specify output file then Master of Sprites will just
                change extension of your project file to raw, prg or asm.

                <em>Unfortunally currenty is not possible to make multiple exports in one
                command by using wildcards like '*' or '?'.</em> On UNIX-like operating
                systems you can do the same job by looping in the shell script or by
                using capabilities of makefiles. Worse if you are using Windows batch
                files - as far as I know there is no looping there. :(
