                Welcome to Master of Sprites manual! Here you will find all info
                about this program which you need. I describe here, mostly the more advanced
                features of this program, but also the more obvious ones are described
                at least shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
                First I describe the menu of the application and its features. Next I
                give you a few wise advices and tips & tricks about using Master
                of Sprites. Last but not least, I describe command line parameters
                of this program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope I explain everything clearly but it is almost imposible to
                do not assume some knowledge from the user of this program. So 
                remember you can always ask the <b>uncle Google</b> if something is
                not clear for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides that, In 'Conclusion' section of this manual, You can find
                contact to the author. So if you have some more particular matter
                or question - feel free to write on this address.
            </p>

        <article>
            <h2><a name="filemenu">1. File Menu</a></h2>
            <p>
                Functionality of this menu is rather <b>pretty obvious</b>, right? So let
                me, to just explain, a few strange decisions I had made during work on
                the Master of Sprites. These are maybe kinda stinky excuses but
                <i>at least you will not wonder</i> why save menu item is always enabled etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                First of all, you probably see the <i>project work time</i> in bottom
                right corner of window. I had added this feature mainly for fun, but
                personally I very like to see the time I have spend on some particular work.
                This time, for reason of simplicity and portability, is saved inside
                project file. So it is the reason why I have left <i>save menu item</i> always
                enabled - to let you all cheat and save >2hr work time when you was
                really watching a soap opera instead of working. <b>Seriously</b> - 
                sometimes there is a need to save the timestamp even if no changes have
                been made.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second matter. On the titlebar, sometimes you can see an <i>indicator of unsaved file</i>,
                the tilde ~. As you probably expect changing background color shall make project unsaved,
                right? Yes, it makes. But this kinda change, unfortunelly is not noticed by undo/redo
                history. But lets leave, all details of this topic, for the second section of manual
                'Edit Menu'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third matter. <i>The lack of a new file dialog.</i> I have decided to do not bother
                the user by settings of memory bank size, default sprite color etc. Anyway,
                these all are very easy to change later. See the section of <i>'Tips & Tricks'</i>
                if you need a crash course in this topic.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ok... Thats maybe all for this section. Remember that sometimes one matter is
                very close to the other one and necessary read my whole rant. Good luck!
            </p>

            <h2><a name="editmenu">2. Edit Menu</a></h2>
            <p>
                Lets divide this section into three smaller ones.
            </p>
            <h3>Undo and Redo History</h3>
            <p>
                As I previously mentioned (see the 'File Menu' section) - not every change
                in project is noticed by the undo/redo history. Generally, Master of
                Sprites push to the history only changes which regards particular sprite or
                sprites. So we do not push such silly changes like changing background or
                one of multicolor mode colors. These are far to easy to reverse, anyway.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rest is pretty typical and default - <span>CTRL-Z</span> to undo, <span>CTRL-Y</span> to redo, nothing
                to specially explain as I think. <b>BTW:</b> History is implemented in a very simple
                way - it simply makes copies of whole memory bank. It is not so huge bulk of
                data for modern computers, however if you want to edit whole 64kB of data (1024
                sprites) - probably you will encounter the noticable slowness.
            </p>
            <h3>Cut/Copy/Paste</h3>
            <p>
                Yes again, pretty obvious topic. But let me shine a bit and mark up that
                Master of Sprites can run multiple instances of itself and you can easily
                copy and paste between them. Just remember to select something first to
                cut or copy it. And to copy something first to paste it.
            </p>
            <h3>Special Paste Modes: AND, OR and XOR</h3>
            <p>
                Now, something what teddy bears like the most. Do you understand what
                are bitwise operators (AND/OR/XOR)? If not then it is somewhat hard to
                explain shortly - please take a look at <b>google</b> or <b>wikipedia</b>. If yes then
                you probably understand well how these three are working.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let me just explain everybody, that these paste modes, are very useful
                when you want to make some change on multiple sprites simultaneously.
                Just play around and try them on some wider selection.
            </p>
            <p><a href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>
        </article>
        
        <article>
            <h2><a name="spritemenu">3. Sprite Menu</a></h2>
            <p>
                In this menu you will find all possible actions regarding particular
                single sprite. Except same drawing maybe. Lets list them all and
                describe briefly:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Setting an unique name</b> - this one is useful only when you
                    want to export your project to assembly code. After you set a
                    name to the sprite, Master of Sprites will add label with your
                    name inside exported asm file. It can be helpful to do not mess
                    around later, with nothing telling labels like sprite0 or sprite31.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Slide</b> - Helpful to move a little your sprite if you did not
                    fitted it perfectly to its frame.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Flip</b> - Now you can create a second version of your sprite turned
                    around in opposive direction!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Reflect</b> - Helps to make perfectly symetrical sprites.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Rotation</b> - Not always working perfectly (especially for multicolor
                    mode effect can be not very accurate) but useful tool to rotate your
                    sprite as needed. Important thing which you can do not notice - in the 
                    rotation dialog you can enter negative number to rotate in opposive direction
                    (counter-clockwise).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Negation</b> - Switching between negative and positive versions
                    of your sprite. You know...
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                All actions in this menu affect only one sprite at the time. See the 'Selection Menu'
                section if you want to read about selection-wide actions.

            <h2><a name="commandlineparameters">5. Command Line Parameters</a></h2>
            <h3>Opening Project From Command Line</h3>
            <p>
                You can automatically open project if you specify its name/path
                from command line:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                java -jar MasterofSprites.jar <i>project_file</i>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                It is sometimes useful because on most modern operating systems,
                then you can drag & drop project file into MasterofSprites.jar
                file, and Master of Sprites will automatically open your project.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Export From Command Line</h3>
            <p>
                Master of Sprites offers option to export its projects from
                command line. Syntax is following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                java -jar MasterofSprites.jar -e [format] <i>project_file</i> [-o <i>output_file</i>]
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Avaible export formats are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Raw format</strong> - leave <i>format</i> argument
                    <b>empty</b> and Master of Sprites will export just same raw
                    binary data of your sprites, without any additional informations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PRG file</strong> - specify <b>load address</b> of prg
                    file as the <i>format</i> argument. Load address should be a
                    <b>hexadecimal number</b> prefixed by <b>'$'</b> or <b>'0x'</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assembler source code</strong> - specify <b>name of
                    assembler</b> and Master of Sprites will write code compatible
                    with syntax of specified assembler. Possible Choices are:
                    <b>kickass</b>, <b>acme</b> or <b>tmpx</b>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not specify output file then Master of Sprites will just

                Master of Sprites is a very cool sprite editor. I think you will
                like it. If you want to share this program with others you are
                very welcome. Just, <b>if it does not make a difference for you</b>,
                please share a link to download from GitHub, instead of copy and
                upload it somewhere else. This helps me to see how many people
                are interested by my program. Thanks.
            </p>
