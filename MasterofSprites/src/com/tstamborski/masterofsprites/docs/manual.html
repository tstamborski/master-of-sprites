            <p>
                Welcome to Master of Sprites manual! Here you will find all info
                about this program which you need. I describe here, mostly the more advanced
                features of this program, but also the more obvious ones are described
                at least shortly.
            </p>
            <p>
                First I describe the menu of the application and its features. Next I
                give you a few wise advices and tips & tricks about using Master
                of Sprites. Last but not least, I describe command line parameters
                of this program.
            </p>
            <p>
                I hope I explain everything clearly but it is almost imposible to
                do not assume some knowledge from the user of this program. So 
                remember you can always ask the uncle Google if something is not clear
                for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides that, In 'Conclusion' section of this manual, You can find
                contact to the author. So if you have some more particular matter
                or question - feel free to write on this address.

            <h2><a name="commandlineparameters">3. Command Line Parameters</a></h2>
            <h3>Opening project from command line.</h3>
            <p>
                You can automatically open project if you specify its name/path
                from command line:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
            <span style="color: white;">java -jar MasterofSprites.jar <i>project_file</i></span>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                It is sometimes useful because on most modern operating systems,
                then you can drag & drop project file into MasterofSprites.jar
                file, and Master of Sprites will automatically open your project.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Export from command line.</h3>
            <p>
                Master of Sprites offers option to export its projects from
                command line. Syntax is following:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <span style="color: white;">java -jar MasterofSprites.jar -e [format] <i>project_file</i> [-o <i>output_file</i>]</span>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Avaible export formats are:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Raw format</strong> - leave <i>format</i> argument
                    <b>empty</b> and Master of Sprites will export just same raw
                    binary data of your sprites, without any additional informations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>PRG file</strong> - specify <b>load address</b> of prg
                    file as the <i>format</i> argument. Load address should be a
                    <b>hexadecimal number</b> prefixed by <b>'$'</b> or <b>'0x'</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Assembler source code</strong> - specify <b>name of
                    assembler</b> and Master of Sprites will write code compatible
                    with syntax of specified assembler. Possible Choices are:
                    <b>kickass</b>, <b>acme</b> or <b>tmpx</b>.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                If you do not specify output file then Master of Sprites will just
                change extension of your project file to raw, prg or asm.
            </p>

            <h2><a name="conclusion">4. Conclusion</a></h2>
            <p>
                Master of Sprites is a very cool sprite editor. I think you will
                like it. If you want to share this program with others you are
                very welcome. Just, <b>if it does not make a difference for you</b>,
                please share a link to download from GitHub, instead of copy and
                upload it somewhere else. This helps me to see how many people
                are interested by my program. Thanks.
            </p>
