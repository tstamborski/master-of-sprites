Java editor for Commodore 64 sprites.

In future, this project can be my humble competition for SubChrist SpritePad. For now, unfortunaly it is still **not finished**.

Recently I had draft a third preview release for anybody who wants to see my program and what works already and what not. **Jar file for download is [here](https://github.com/tstamborski/master-of-sprites/releases/download/v0.8/MasterofSprites.jar).** Check it out.
