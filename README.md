# ![](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons/blob/main/png/commodore-tool32.png) Master of Sprites
Java editor for Commodore 64 sprites.
In future, this project can be my humble competition for SubChrist SpritePad. For now, unfortunaly it is **far from being finished and useful**. I keep it here for reason of some kinda backup.
