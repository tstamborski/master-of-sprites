# ![](https://github.com/tstamborski/pixelart-icons/blob/main/png/commodore-tool32.png) Master of Sprites
Java editor for Commodore 64 sprites.

In future, this project can be my humble competition for SubChrist SpritePad. For now, unfortunaly it is **far from being finished and useful**. I keep it here for reason of some kinda backup. ðŸ™‚

**Edit:** Recently I had draft a preview release for anybody who wants to see my program and what works already and what not. **Jar file for download is [here](https://github.com/tstamborski/master-of-sprites/releases/download/v0.4/MasterofSprites.jar).** Theoretically is even already useful - at least if better editors would not exist. ;)
